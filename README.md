# System-Design-Resources

This repository contains free videos, articles, support links and other relevant materials for preparation of System Design Technical Interview. I will be adding more resources soon. Feel free to contribute relevant topics/articles which may be missing.

## About

Cracking interviews of technical companies like amazon, uber, etc. require a strong understanding of topics like data structures, algorithms, DBMS, OS and Networking. It has been noticed that more and more companies are inclining towards taking a separate System Design interview, especially for SDE roles. Since the resources for System Design preparation are either paid or scattered, here is a compilation of topics that one may go through for their preparation.

## Prerequisites
One must revise basics of DBMS, OS and networking before moving to designing systems.
Some resources are shared below.
